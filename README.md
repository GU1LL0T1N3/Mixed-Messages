# Mixed-Messages
## Description
This is my finished code for the Mixed Messages project from Codecademy. The goal is to make a program that generates a random message (the message can be anything!) I decided to go with a message related to my favorite hobby: Magic, The Gathering. The program randomly chooses 3 of the 5 colors from Magic and generates a message giving the clan name and the section name of the chosen colors. If you would like more context, check this [Magic wiki link.](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Multicolored#Color_triples)

## Running the program
The program runs from invoking the function clanAndColors() that is located at the bottom of the .js file.
